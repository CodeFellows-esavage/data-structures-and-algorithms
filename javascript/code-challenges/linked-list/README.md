## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
I utlized the demo from class and my white board image to help me walk through what I needed to do in order to properly create each method for the linked list. I utlized console logs during development to check what my list was doing. For adding an item to the list the efficency is O(1) because the 1 item is added at the begining. For includs and toString, the efficency is O(n) because worst case would be iterating through the whole linked list each time and it directly grows with n.
